The latch tx_module/fifo_rd_en_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tx_module/fifo_rd_en_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#25 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch tx_module/tx_reg/L7 (in tx_module/tx_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tx_module/tx_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#26 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch tx_module/tx_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin tx_module/tx_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 26 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
